      <h3>The Issue with SimCitying</h3>
      <p>In the Civilization series there is the concept of SimCitying &ndash; focusing on growing economically as fast as possible by </p>
      <ol>
      <li>sacrificing short and medium term aggressive (and non-necessary defensive) military development, and</li>
      <li>micromanaging your economic development via build-orders, city-placement, and terrain improvements</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <p>I won&rsquo;t go so far as to say that the viability of this strategy in a game is in-and-of-itself bad, but here are the problems that I think are related to it.</p>
      <p>In Civ 5 this strategy is too strong relative to aggressive military strategies &ndash; multiplayer games are often won by the person who most effectively strikes a balance between defending and SimCitying.</p>
      <p>But, the bigger issue, as I see it, is not only that SimCitying is too strong relative to military strategies. </p>
      <p>Rather, it is that in any game with a defender advantage mechanic (which, I think, is necessary) and the ability to SimCity, the optimal strategy is to SimCity as much as possible and only defend to the bare minimum that is required to protect yourself. </p>
      <p>The only time an aggressive military strategy works between equally powerful players is if one of them underproduces defensive military capabilities (i.e., only if one player makes a mistake).</p>
      <p>This results in a game where winning is a matter of accurately estimating your own military strength and your opponents&rsquo; military strength. And if all players do this well enough the outcome of them game will be determined by the players&rsquo; ability to SimCity.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>How Economics and Military Is Handled Instead</h3>
      <p>The idea with Civ-Diplomacy is that in order avoid the proliferation of SimCitying and encourage aggressive military action there is a system wherein military and economic growth are decoupled &ndash; growing your capacity to produce military units does not come at the cost of actually building military units. </p>
      <p>What this means is that armies are essentially &ldquo;free&rdquo;, and, as a result, there is no reason not to constantly have a standing army. And if you have a standing army there&rsquo;s no point in not using it to attack if you&rsquo;re not busy defending.</p>
