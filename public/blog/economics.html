      <h3>The Issue with SimCitying</h3>
      <p>In the Civilization series there is the concept of SimCitying &ndash; focusing on growing economically as fast as possible by</p>
      <ol>
      <li>sacrificing short and medium term aggressive (and in many cases, defensive) military development, and</li>
      <li>micromanaging your economic development via build-orders, city-placement, and terrain improvements</li>
      </ol>
      <p>I won&rsquo;t go so far as to say that the viability of this strategy in a game is in-and-of-itself bad, but here are the problems that I think are related to it.</p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>In Civ 5 this strategy is too strong relative to aggressive military strategies &ndash; multiplayer games are often one by the person who most effectively defends and SimCitys.</p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>But the bigger issue, as I see it, is not only that SimCitying is too strong relative to military strategies.</p>
      <p>Rather, it is that in any game with a defender advantage mechanic (which, I think, is necessary) and the ability to SimCity, the optimal strategy, assuming all players are abiding by it, is to SimCity as much as possible and only defend to the bare minimum that is required to protect yourself.</p>
      <p>The only time an aggressive military strategy works between equally powerful players is if one underproduces defensive military capabilities (i.e., only if one player makes a mistake).</p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>This results in a game where winning is a matter of accurately estimating your own military strength and your opponents&rsquo; military strength. And if all players do this well enough the entire game will be determined by the players&rsquo; ability to SimCity.</p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <h3>How Economics and Military Is Handled Instead</h3>
      <p>The idea with Civ-Diplomacy is that to avoid the proliferation of SimCitying and encourage aggressive military action there is system wherein military and economic growth are decoupled &ndash; growing your capacity to produce military units does not come in conflict with actually building military units.</p>
      <p>What this means is that creating armies are essentially &ldquo;free&rdquo; and, as a result, there is not reason not to constantly have a standing army. And if you have a standing army there&rsquo;s no point in not using it to attack if you&rsquo;re not busy defending.</p>
